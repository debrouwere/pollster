Custom Pollster views

* velocity: what content is trending on which social platform?
  (volume + acceleration)
  -- perhaps useful data for automatically generating trailblocks
  or other features on the site (Zeitgeist)
* performance relative to a tag, author, ... as well as time since publication
  (either articles that conform to all of these, or different performance
  indicators for each)

Apps that build on Pollster

* pollster-leaderboard
  - top social (FB, Twitter, ...) but also pageviews etc.
    for an arbitrary time range
  - split by section, tag, etc.
  - flexible facet system (determine what exactly counts
    as a section, tag etc. in your setup)
* pollster-dashboard
  - with the same facet system as above, provide
    at-a-glance information about all (recent) articles 
    in a section, tag, or by a certain author
    and how well they did as compared against the average
    for the parent section / globally
* pollster-archive
  - archive any page and (optionally) keep polling
    for changes
* pollster-link-scanner
  - follow every link in a piece of content and archive those pages
  - custom view that redirects to the original if it still
    exists, or to the archived version if it doesn't anymore

Plus various one-off analyses

* correlate social shares with in-site promotion
* (with 7-day aggregates) what kinds of articles resonate more?
* what percentage of articles get x% of shares past the first
  couple of days (late bloomers and rediscovered content)
* ...
